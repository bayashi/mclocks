## Download

From https://github.com/bayashi/mclocks/releases

### Windows

For Windows, you can get `.msi` or `.exe` installer.

### macOS

For macOS, you can get `.dmg` to install.

### Linux

For Linux, you can get `.deb`, `.rpm` or `.AppImage`.

## config.json

The `config.json` file allows you to configure the clocks according to your preferences.

There is no GUI(Graphical User Interface) for editing the `config.json` file in `com.bayashi.mclocks`. You will need to manually create and open and edit it using your text editor.

The `config.json` file should be located in the following directories:

* Windows: `C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Roaming\com.bayashi.mclocks\`
* Mac: `/Users/{USER}/Library/Application Support/com.bayashi.mclocks/`
* Linux: `/home/{USER}/.config/com.bayashi.mclocks/`

### Backwards Compatibility Notes

The directory of the `config.json` file has been changed to `com.bayashi.mclocks` from just `mclocks` after version 0.2.9. Please create and move your old `mclocks/config.json` to new directory `com.bayashi.mclocks/config.json` if necessary.

(Actually, the `mclocks` can load old config path so far though)

### Example of config.json

The `config.json` file should be formatted as JSON, as shown below.

    {
      "clocks": [
        { "name": "UTC", "timezone": "UTC" }
      ],
      "format": "MM-DD ddd HH:mm",
      "locale": "en",
      "color": "#fff",
      "font": "Courier, monospace",
      "size": 14,
      "margin": "1.65em",
      "forefront": false
    }

## The fields of config.json

#### clocks

The `clocks` field is an array of objects, each containing `name` and `timezone` properties. Both should be String.

* `name` is a label that will be displayed for the clock.
* For selecting time zones, please refer to this [list of time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

Here is an example of a `clocks` array for three time zones.

    {
      "clocks": [
        { "name": "Tokyo", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo" },
        { "name": "UTC", "timezone": "UTC" },
        { "name": "SF", "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles" }
      ],
      "format": "MM-DD ddd HH:mm",
      ...snip...
    }

#### format

The `format` field is a date-time format string used to display the clock. To create a custom date-time format, please refer to [this formatting guide](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/).

#### format2

The `format2` field is same as `format`. These are switched each other by clicking the mclocks. The `format2` is optional field.

#### locale

The `locale` field determines the language settings for displaying the date-time. You can find [a list of supported locales here](https://github.com/kawanet/cdate-locale/blob/main/locales.yml).

#### color

The `color` field defines the color of the date-time text. You can use named colors, RGB hex values, RGB values (e.g., RGB(255, 0, 0)), or any valid CSS color value.

#### font

The `font` is a font name to display date-time. It should be monospaced font. If you would set non-fixed-width font, then your mclocks may have an undesirable wobbling effect.

#### size

The `size` is a size of charactor for date-time, in pixel.

#### margin

The `margin` field determines the space between clocks

#### forefront

If the `forefront` field is set to `true`, the mclocks application will always be displayed on top of other application windows. 

### Countdown clock

By setting up the config as shown below for the `clock`, it will be displayed as a countdown clock to a given date-time.

	"clocks": [
		{
			"countdown": "WAC Tokyo D-%D %h:%m:%s",
			"target": "2025-09-13",
			"timezone": "Asia/Tokyo"
		}
	],

Above countdown `clock` will be displayed like below:

    WAC Tokyo D-159 12:34:56

Indicating 159 days, 12 hours, 34 minutes, and 56 seconds left until September 13, 2025.

###### Countdown format verbs

The countdown text accepts template verbs below:

* `%TG`: Target date-time string
* `%D`: Remaining day count to target date-time
* `%H`: Remaining time as hour to target date-time
* `%h`: An hour(hh) of remaining time (hh:mm:ss)
* `%M`: Remaining time as minute to target date-time
* `%m`: A minute(mm) of remaining time (hh:mm:ss)
* `%S`: Remaining time as second to target date-time
* `%m`: A second(ss) of remaining time (hh:mm:ss)
