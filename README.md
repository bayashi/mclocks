In addition, it also includes features:

* Timer
* Countdown timer
* Epoch time and date-time convertor

`mclocks` doesn't need an internet connection ‚Äî everything runs 100% locally.

## Download

From https://github.com/bayashi/mclocks/releases

NOTE: Since macOS binary and Linux binary occasionally don't work properly. Please feel free to open an issue.

### Windows

For Windows, you can get the installer `.msi` file, or `.exe` the executable file.

### macOS

For macOS, you can get `.dmg` file to install.

(The shortcut keys in this document are for Windows OS. If you are using macOS, please interpret them accordingly, replacing keys such as `Ctrl` with `Ctrl + Command` and `Alt` with `Option` where appropriate.)

### Linux

For Linux, you can get `.deb`, `.rpm` or `.AppImage` file to install.

## config.json

The `config.json` file allows you to configure the clocks according to your preferences.

The `config.json` file should be located in the following directories:

* Windows: `C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Roaming\com.bayashi.mclocks\`
* Mac: `/Users/{USER}/Library/Application Support/com.bayashi.mclocks/`
* Linux: `/home/{USER}/.config/com.bayashi.mclocks/`

When you start `mclocks`, then press `Ctrl + o` to edit your `config.json` file.

### Backwards Compatibility Notes

The directory of the `config.json` file has been changed to `com.bayashi.mclocks` from just `mclocks` after version 0.2.9.

And after version 0.2.13, old `config.json` file is automatically migrated into new directory if the new config file doesn't exist.

### Example of config.json

The `config.json` file should be formatted as JSON, as shown like below.

    {
      "clocks": [
        { "name": "UTC", "timezone": "UTC" }
      ],
      "format": "MM-DD ddd HH:mm",
      "locale": "en",
      "color": "#fff",
      "font": "Courier, monospace",
      "size": 14,
      "margin": "1.65em",
      "forefront": false
    }

## The fields of config.json

#### clocks

The `clocks` field is an array of objects, each containing `name` and `timezone` properties. Both should be String. By default, both are `UTC`.

* `name` is a label that will be displayed for the clock.
* For selecting time zones, please refer to this [list of time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

Here is an example of a `clocks` array for three time zones.

    {
      "clocks": [
        { "name": "Tokyo", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo" },
        { "name": "UTC", "timezone": "UTC" },
        { "name": "SF", "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles" }
      ],
      "format": "MM-DD ddd HH:mm",
      ...snip...
    }

#### format

string: `MM-DD ddd HH:mm`

The `format` field is a date-time format string used to display the clock. To create a custom date-time format, please refer to [this formatting guide](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/).

#### format2

string: `""`

The `format2` field is same as `format`. These are switched each other by `Ctrl + f` key. The `format2` is optional field.

#### locale

string: `en`

The `locale` field determines the language settings for displaying the date-time. You can find [a list of supported locales here](https://github.com/kawanet/cdate-locale/blob/main/locales.yml).

#### color

string: `#fff`

The `color` field defines the color of the date-time text. You can use named colors, RGB hex values, RGB values (e.g., `RGB(255, 0, 0)`), or any valid CSS color value.

#### font

string: `Courier, monospace`

The `font` is a font name to display date-time. It should be monospaced font. If you would set non-fixed-width font, then your mclocks may have an undesirable wobbling effect.

#### size

number | string: 14

The `size` is a size of charactor for date-time, in pixel. It can also be specified as a string that includes a unit (e.g., `"125%"`, `"1.5em"`).

#### margin

string: `1.65em`

The `margin` field determines the space between clocks

#### forefront

bool: `false`

If the `forefront` field is set to `true`, the mclocks application will always be displayed on top of other application windows. 

## Countdown clock

By setting up the config as shown below for the `clock`, it will be displayed as a countdown clock to a given `target` date-time.

	"clocks": [
		{
			"countdown": "WAC Tokyo D-%D %h:%m:%s",
			"target": "2025-09-13",
			"timezone": "Asia/Tokyo"
		}
	],

Above countdown `clock` will be displayed like below:

    WAC Tokyo D-159 12:34:56

Indicating 159 days, 12 hours, 34 minutes, and 56 seconds left until September 13, 2025.

### Countdown format verbs

The `countdown` fieled text accepts below template verbs:

* `%TG`: Target date-time string
* `%D`: Remaining day count to target date-time
* `%H`: Remaining time as hour to target date-time
* `%h`: An hour(hh) of remaining time (hh:mm:ss)
* `%M`: Remaining time as minute to target date-time
* `%m`: A minute(mm) of remaining time (hh:mm:ss)
* `%S`: Remaining time as second to target date-time
* `%s`: A second(ss) of remaining time (hh:mm:ss)

## Simple Timer

![simple timer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bayashi/mclocks/main/screenshot/mclocks-screenshot-timer.png)

Click `mclocks` app window, then push `Ctrl + 1` key, then start 1-minute timer. Push `Ctrl + Alt + 1` key, start 10-minute timer. Other number keys work as well. Starting timers up to 5.

`Ctrl + p` to pause / re-start the timers.

`Ctrl + 0` to delete the oldest timer. `Ctrl + Alt + 0` to delete the newest timer.

NOTE: Countdown clock and simple timer will send notification by default when the timer is complete. If you don't need notifications, set `withoutNotification: true` in `config.json`.

## Display Epoch time

![epoch-time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bayashi/mclocks/main/screenshot/mclocks-screenshot-epoch-time.png)

Click `mclocks` app window, then push `Ctrl + e` key, then toggle to display Epoch time.

## Convert between date-time and Epoch time

Click `mclocks` app window, then paste a date-time or Epoch time, then a dialog appears to display conversion results. And it's able to copy the results to the clipboard. If you don't want to copy, then press `[No]` to just close the dialog.

When pasting with `Ctrl + v`, the value (Epoch time) is treated as seconds. If you use `Ctrl + Alt + v`, it's treated as milliseconds, and with `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + V`, it's treated as microseconds, and with `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + N + V`, it's treated as nanoseconds and converted accordingly.
