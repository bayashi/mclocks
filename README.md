## Window state file

If you want to reset your mclock where it's located in your screen, then please try to remove `window-state.json` in your App data directory. That file would be generated by mclock automatically to keep the location and the size of your mclocks.

## How to close mclock

Windows

* Right click, then select `close`
* Alt + F4

Mac

* Select `Quit` from Dock
